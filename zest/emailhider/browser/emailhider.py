    The object is given by a uid.

    Special case: when the uid contains 'email' or 'address' it is
    clearly no real uid.  In that case we do nothing with the
    IMailable interface but we try to get a property with this 'uid'
    from the property sheet of the portal.  Main use case is of course
    the 'email_from_address', but you can add other addresses as
