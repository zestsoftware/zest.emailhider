History of zest.emailhider package
==================================


2.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Added two upgrade steps to upgrade from 1.x by installing
  jquery.pyproxy and running our kss step (which just removes our
  no longer needed kss file).
  [maurits]


2.0 (2010-12-09)
----------------

- Use jquery.pyproxy instead of KSS.  This makes the page load much
  less for anonymous users.
  [vincent+maurits]


1.3 (2009-12-28)
----------------

- Made reveal_email available always, as it should just work whenever
  we want to hide the glocal 'email_from_address'.  If we have a real
  uid target, then try to adapt that target to the IMailable interface
  and if that fails we just silently do nothing.
  [maurits]


1.2 (2008-11-19)
----------------

- Using kss.plugin.cacheability and added it as a dependency.  [jladage]

- Allow to set the uid to email_from_address.  [jladage]

- Changed the KSS to use the load event instead of the click event - it 
  now either works transparently, or asks the user to activate JS. [simon]


1.1 (2008-10-24)
----------------

- Added translations and modified template to use them. [simon]

- Initial creation of project. [simon]


1.0 (2008-10-20)
