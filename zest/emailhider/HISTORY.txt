History of zest.emailhider package
==================================


2.4 (2011-05-10)
----------------

- Updated jquery.pyproxy dependency to at least 0.3.1 and removed the
  now no longer needed clean_string call.

2.3 (2010-12-15)
----------------

- Not only look up a fake uid for email_from_address as portal
  property, but do this for any fake uid that has 'email' or 'address'
  in it.  Log warnings when no email address can be found for a fake
  or real uid.

2.2 (2010-12-14)
----------------

- Added another upgrade step as we definitely need to apply our
  javascript registry too when upgrading.  Really at this point a
  plain reinstall in the portal_quickinstaller is actually fine, which
  we could also define as upgrade step, but never mind that now.
  [maurits]


2.1 (2010-12-14)
----------------

- Added two upgrade steps to upgrade from 1.x by installing
  jquery.pyproxy and running our kss step (which just removes our
  no longer needed kss file).
  [maurits]


2.0 (2010-12-09)
----------------

- Use jquery.pyproxy instead of KSS.  This makes the page load much
  less for anonymous users.
  [vincent+maurits]


1.3 (2009-12-28)
----------------

- Made reveal_email available always, as it should just work whenever
  we want to hide the glocal 'email_from_address'.  If we have a real
  uid target, then try to adapt that target to the IMailable interface
  and if that fails we just silently do nothing.
  [maurits]


1.2 (2008-11-19)
----------------

- Using kss.plugin.cacheability and added it as a dependency.  [jladage]

- Allow to set the uid to email_from_address.  [jladage]

- Changed the KSS to use the load event instead of the click event - it 
  now either works transparently, or asks the user to activate JS. [simon]


1.1 (2008-10-24)
----------------

- Added translations and modified template to use them. [simon]

- Initial creation of project. [simon]


1.0 (2008-10-20)
----------------

- Initial creation of project. [simon]
